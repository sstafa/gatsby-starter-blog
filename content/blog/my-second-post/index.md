# Silly Seals

Seals, like all organisms, they do not always follow the rules.

### Ribbon Seals

While sexual dimorphism is not unique to ribbon seals, they have a very interesting pattern that makes them unique.  These seals have stripes or *ribbons*.

|    Sex    | Coloring       |   
| :----- | :---------------------------------------: |
| Male     | Black Body|
|   | White Stripes | 
| Female     | Brown Body | 
|  | Tan Stripes| 

These seals also play dead when scared which is unique to them completely.

### Crabeater Seals

These seals do not move on land like other seals do.  They slither instead of bounce.
